# Independent Study Work

This is just a repository to help track academic math and physics work I do independently of my
classwork. (Exercises and whatnot).

## Why?
I'm an undergrad student with a bad track record for work ethic; this is to help me catch up on
material I need to know, while enabling me to provide concrete evidence for my improvement (to both
myself, and others). I'm hoping to push changes at least daily.

tl;dr: it's to reinforce a good habit I want to build.

## Copyright

The exercises themselves are copyrighted material from the texts wherein they were found. I do not
own any of that myself.

All other work, however, is original, and is licensed under the GNU Free Document License.

## Contributing

I'm not really looking for co-contributors for as-of-yet unsolved problems in my problem sets.
However, if you have any suggestions concerning style, or logical fallacies, I would greatly
appreciate it!
